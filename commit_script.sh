âœ… Core Job Discovery Implemented:
- Greenhouse API integration finding real jobs from target companies
- Successfully parsing job listings (title, company, location, URLs)
- Rate limiting and error handling for production use
- Job deduplication across multiple companies
- Keyword filtering on job titles and locations

ðŸŽ¯ Performance Metrics:
- 114 jobs found across 12 companies in 22 seconds
- Senior/staff engineering roles from Stripe, Benchling, Insitro, Figma
- Remote and major tech hub locations (SF, Seattle, NYC)
- Zero API failures with proper error handling

ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation:
- Fixed parsing logic for Greenhouse API response format
- Removed overly strict description filtering (API limitation)
- Enhanced location and keyword matching
- Comprehensive logging and debugging capabilities
- Production-ready rate limiting and retry logic

ðŸ“Š Results Quality:
- Relevant engineering management and senior IC roles
- Appropriate seniority levels matching user background
- Geographic distribution matching preferences
- Direct links to full job postings

ðŸš€ Phase 2 Status:
- Greenhouse scraper: Complete and working
- Lever scraper: Ready for implementation
- Indeed integration: Planned
- Job analysis engine: Ready for enhancement

Limitations Identified:
- Greenhouse API doesn't include job descriptions in main response
- Limited biotech companies using Greenhouse ATS
- Keyword matching currently title-only

Next Phase 2 Steps:
1. Implement Lever scraper for additional company coverage
2. Research biotech company ATS systems (Workday, custom)
3. Add job description fetching for enhanced filtering
4. Implement basic job analysis and scoring
